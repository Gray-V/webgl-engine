| Category | Feedback | Points |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| Stub web app | Stub web app provides testbed for scene library | 5/5 |
| | **Screen construct/framework** | |
| • Setup | Scene code is structured to handle WebGL setup and connection to `canvas` in a reusable manner | 4/4 |
| • Add/remove | `Scene` handles addition and removal | 4/4 |
| • Rendering | Scene code renders to a canvas in a reusable manner | 4/4 |
| • Implementation | No implementation issues found | 3/3 |
| | **3D object framework** | |
| • Different shapes | Framework accommodates different shapes | 2/2 |
| • Color | 3D object framework stores at least a single color | 2/2 |
| • Groups/composites | 3D object framework includes group functionality, although not as an explicit group/composite construct—this is functionally OK but the design choice feels a tad less readable—i.e., the creation of groups and adding children to them feels more explicit than creating children and invoking `setParent` | 8/8 |
| • Implementation | 3D object framework implementation is clear and straightforward.  | 3/3 |
| | **Polygon mesh data structure** | |
| • Vertices/triangles | Mesh data structure stores vertices and faces (triangles) appropriately. | 10/10 |
| • Extensibility | Mesh data structure design allows for easy extension to accommodate future values | 5/5 |
| • Solid vs. wireframe | Mesh data structure produces wireframe and solid renders in a straightforward manner | 5/5 |
| • Implementation | Mesh implementation is done well. | 5/5 |
| | **Mesh maker library** | |
| • Sphere | Sphere is implemented correctly | 20/20 |
| • _shape-credits.md_ | Credits present |  |
| • Implementation | Shape framework is overall implemented consistently and sufficiently well | 10/10 |
| Extra credit (if any) |  |  |
| Code maintainability | No issues with maintainability,  |  |
| Code readability | Good readability. |  |
| Version control | Decent commit granularity with sufficiently descriptive messages |  |
| Punctuality | Tagged commit made 4/7.
