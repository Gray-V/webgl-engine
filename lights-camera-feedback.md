| Category | Feedback | Points |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| | **Normal vectors** | |
| • Computation | Normal vectors are computed correctly | 10/10 |
| • Faceted and smooth looks | Faceted and smooth normals are computed correctly | 5/5 |
| • Storage | Normals are appropriately stored within 3D objects | 9/9 |
| • GLSL | Normal vectors are passed into GLSL correctly | 6/6 |
| | **Lighting** | |
| • Modeling | Light modeling is present but in the form of hardcoded constants—additional refactoring is required in order to produce something that is more configurable and dynamic (–5) | 5/10 |
| • GLSL | Light settings are passed correctly to GLSL as uniform variables | 10/10 |
| • Computation | Lighting computations are done correctly! | 20/20 |
| | **Camera** | |
| • Look-at | The look-at (camera) matrix is computed correctly | 10/10 |
| • Modeling | The camera object is modeled well. | 7/7 |
| • Shader | The camera matrix is successfully passed into and used by the shader code | 3/3 |
| | **Usage in Scene** | |
| | The scene shows off the latest lighting and camera features | 10/10 |
| Texture mapping (if any) |  |  |
| Code maintainability | No issues with maintainability |  |
| Code readability | No readability issues found |  |
| Version control | Decent commit granularity with sufficiently descriptive messages |  |
