| Category | Feedback | Points |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| | **4×4 matrix object/library** | |
| • Identity | New matrix defaults to the identity matrix | 2/2 |
| • Multiplication | Matrix multiplication is implemented correctly | 8/8 |
| • Team matrix | We will arbitrarily take orthographic projection as the “group” matrix because according to the credits file every matrix was done individually | 4/4 |
| • GLSL conversion | Conversion to column-major 1D `Float32Array` is implemented | 3/3 |
| • Implementation | The matrix library is implemented well | 5/5 |
| | **Matrix test suite** | |
| • Identity test | Identity matrix default is explicitly tested | 1/1 |
| • Identity coverage | Identity matrix default is fully covered by tests | 1/1 |
| • Multiplication test | Matrix multiplication is explicitly tested | 4/4 |
| • Multiplication coverage | Matrix multiplication is fully covered by tests | 4/4 |
| • Team matrix test | All matrices are explicitly tested | 2/2 |
| • Team matrix coverage | All tests are covered | 2/2 |
| • GLSL conversion test | There is no explicit WebGL conversion function, but there are tests that check for correct converted values | 2/2 |
| • GLSL conversion coverage | Tests are fully covered | 1/1 |
| • _matrix-credits.md_ | _matrix-credits.md_ clearly lists who did what |  |
| | **Matrix use in 3D objects** | |
| • Instance transformation | An instance transform is maintained and used | 10/10 |
| • Parent propagation | Groups propagate their transforms properly | 15/15 |
| • Implementation | Matrix used by 3D objects is implemented well | 5/5 |
| | **Matrix use in projection** | |
| • Usage when rendering | Projection matrix is implemented | 10/10 |
| • Implementation | Projection matrices are implemented well | 5/5 |
| Extra credit (if any) | Loading a 3D model from a JSON file is implemented (+5) | 5 |
| Code maintainability | No issues with maintainability |  |
| Code readability | No major readability issues |  |
| Version control | Decent commit granularity with sufficiently descriptive messages |  |
| Punctuality | Accommodated to 4/16 11:59:59.999pm due to time constraints<br /><br /> **Graded commit:** [3694abf2a2e1d26fe5cb0f11110c70a4356d4a67](https://github.com/lmu-cmsi3710-spring2025/our-own-3d-library-theadultsaretalking/commit/3694abf2a2e1d26fe5cb0f11110c70a4356d4a67) |  |
